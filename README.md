# How-to-Improve-Flood-Protection

Instruction for the code:

1.) The data and the code is inside Ciliwung data.xslm -> inside All Codes folder.

2.) Open the developer tab and open visual basic.

3.) On the top right hand side there is arrow bar where you can choose any function to call.

Below is the function correspond to the results (function name -> graph name):

equation2 -> the 3-panel graph (exclude the FEV shaded region).

shadedarea -> the FEV shaded region (blue).

mitigation -> the mitigation scheme (the colour is manually added).

threedshape -> 2-meter deep square lake.

FEV -> FEV-ht and 2-meter deep square - ht graph.

ratingcurve -> only the rating curve graph.

p.s. : After you call the function. you need to delete the existing graph before run the function again. Since the nickname ofthe graph already exist. Unless, you change the nickname of the graph in the code. (I add -readertest to show the graph is call by you)

Test River: Don, Aire and Thames River

08/06 Try plot simple graph in VBA excel.

12/06 Tried to reproduce python plot for every river in one python code (Don, aire, Caldron, Thames) + upload the result for thames river
